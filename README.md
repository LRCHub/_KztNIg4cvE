[00:24.70] She wakes up early every morning
[00:27.77] Just to do her hair now
[00:30.06] Because she cares you all
[00:42.56] 
[00:32.43] Her day oh wouldn't be right
[00:35.61] Without her make up
[00:37.46] She's never had a make up
[00:40.62] She's just like you and me
[00:43.57] But she's homeless, she's homeless
[00:48.02] As she stand there, singing for money

[01:29.11] In my sleep I see her begging
[01:31.71] Reaching police
[01:36.99] Although her body's not mine
[01:39.90] I ask now I do, now I do
[01:51.90] 
[01:43.95] She's just like you and me
[01:47.36] But she's homeless, she's homeless
[01:51.76] As she stands there singing for money

[02:12.99] 
[02:49.63] She's just like you and me
[02:51.71] As she stands there singing for money
